- go through the codebase
- In my codebase there are multiple lists in multiple folders. In those list we have action column, in that action column we have action button like edit,view,delete,archive.\
Now your task is to check all those buttons are working as per their functionality or not in all those list tables. If they are not working add the functionality so they will work.
